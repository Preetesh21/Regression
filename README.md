# GPR
A Gaussian process defines a probability distribution over functions.
Gaussian process can also be seen as an infinite dimensional generalization of multivariate Gaussian distribution.
To define a Gaussian process, we need the following two functions:
```
*Mean Function: * 𝜇:ℝ 𝑑→ℝ 

*Covariance Function: * 𝑘:ℝ 𝑑×𝑑→ℝ 
```

The covariance function is a kernel function that should satisfy the usual properties that are imposed on a kernel function.

This was taught to me during my Fundamental Of Data Sciences Course with another souces of help being this [video](https://youtu.be/xBE8qdAAj3w)
